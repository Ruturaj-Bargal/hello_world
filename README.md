# hello_world
This is my first repository on GitHub. Learning to manage code
I am Ruturaj Bargal, i just graduated from IIT Madras. It is India's No.1 Engineering College. I didnot do much coding in my undergrad. I mostly hustled and managed to submit the codes in time. i regret not paying attention to this part of me now. I also pledge that before my birthday i.e 6th September. I will spend 1000 hours coding. That is my resolution.  Stay tuned for my code updates on GutHub.
